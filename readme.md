This is a fun wee demo of how to use the Xen hypervison with the Zynq Ultrascale+.

We've made a "Lan-Party on Chip". We play a lovely ascii-art game called 0verkill (with a zero, not an o) with clients and a server which are all running in isolated Linux instances.

For any cheaters, run the scripts in the ```auto``` folder. Otherwise, check out the full tutorial in a book we've written! (not yet completed... hold tight for link!)
